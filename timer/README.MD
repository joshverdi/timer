Overview

Timer is a handy stopwatch/chronometer developped inside Neurone Touch Lab. The project was originally motivated by the fact that it was not easy to find a timer tool for linux users, to the point that it becomes a shame for us linux users. In that perspective, Neurone Touch Lab's team, based in Madagascar, has developped and shared this tool in the hope that it can be helpful to everyone. This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.

Terms of use

Timer is free, and distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL). Essentially, this means that you are free to do almost exactly what you want with the program, including distributing it among your friends, making it available for download from your web site, selling it (either by itself or as part of some bigger software package), or using it as the starting point for a software project of your own.

The only real limitation is that whenever you distribute Timer in some way, you must always include the full source code, or a pointer to where the source code can be found. If you make any changes to the source code, these changes must also be made available under the GPL.

For full details, read the copy of the GPL found in the file named License.txt.
